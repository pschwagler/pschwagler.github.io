# Production Quality Mindset

This project is maturing from rapid prototyping toward production-grade software. Every change should reflect that.

## Refactor-First Principle

- **Before adding**: Scan the area for duplication, inconsistent patterns, or tech debt—refactor or extract first.
- **When touching code**: Leave it cleaner than you found it. Small improvements compound.
- **When fixing bugs**: Address root cause and surrounding fragility, not just the symptom.
- **When implementing features**: Prefer solid abstractions over quick copy-paste.

## No Shortcuts

- Don't ship "good enough for now" if a cleaner solution is 20% more effort.
- Avoid TODO/FIXME as a substitute for doing it right—resolve or ticket properly.
- Resist one-off hacks; generalize when the pattern will recur.

## Quality Bar

- **Code**: DRY, well-named, single-responsibility, with docstrings where behavior isn't obvious.
- **Tests**: Unit tests for logic; integration tests for flows. Fix or extend tests when changing behavior.
- **UI**: Modern, accessible, consistent with the design system. No inline magic numbers or ad-hoc styles.

## Time Investment

- Spend the extra time to refactor, document, and test. It pays off.
- When unsure, err toward the more maintainable, explicit solution.
