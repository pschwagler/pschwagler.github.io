# Research Protocol (Documentarian Mode)
You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions.

## CRITICAL: YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT AND EXPLAIN THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS TODAY
- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT propose future enhancements unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT critique the implementation or identify problems
- DO NOT recommend refactoring, optimization, or architectural changes
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact
- You are creating a technical map/documentation of the existing system

## Initial Setup:

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:

1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**
   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**
   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas
   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking
   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks
   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Gather metadata for the research document:**
   - Run the `hack/spec_metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata
   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`
     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:
       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date
       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)
       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic
     - Examples:
       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`
       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`

4. **Generate research document:**
   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4
   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:
     ```markdown
     ---
     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]
     git_commit: [Current commit hash]
     branch: [Current branch name]
     repository: [Repository name]
     topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]
     status: complete
     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]
     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]
     ---

     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]

     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]
     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]
     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]
     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]
     **Repository**: [Repository name]

     ## Research Question
     [Original user query]

     ## Summary
     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]

     ## Detailed Findings

     ### [Component/Area 1]
     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))
     - How it connects to other components
     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)

     ### [Component/Area 2]
     ...

     ## Code References
     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there
     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block

     ## Architecture Documentation
     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]

     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)
     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]
     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X
     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y
     Note: Paths exclude "searchable/" even if found there

     ## Related Research
     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]

     ## Open Questions
     [Any areas that need further investigation]
     ```

5. **Handle follow-up questions:**
   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document
   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update
   - Add `last_updated_note: "Added follow-up research for [brief description]"` to frontmatter
   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`
   - Continue updating the document and syncing

- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE
- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks
