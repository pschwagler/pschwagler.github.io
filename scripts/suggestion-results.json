    "question": "Tell me how this site works",
    "answer": "This site uses an AI-powered system to answer your questions. When you ask a question:\n\n1.  **Verification & Rate Limiting**: Cloudflare Turnstile verifies you're human, and rate limiting prevents abuse.\n2.  **RAG Process**: Your question is converted into a vector embedding and matched against relevant content chunks from Patrick's markdown files (experience, projects, skills, etc.) stored in Supabase using `pgvector`.\n3.  **AI Generation**: The most relevant content chunks are fed into a prompt with your question, and the AI (primarily Gemini 2.5 Flash, with Claude as a fallback) generates a response.\n4.  **Streaming & Follow-ups**: The AI response is streamed back to you, and contextually relevant follow-up questions are suggested.\n\nOn the backend, a sync pipeline reads markdown files from the `content/` directory, chunks them, generates embeddings, and stores them in Supabase, making content updates straightforward.\n\nThe site is built with React Router 7 (with SSR), Tailwind v4 for styling, and hosted on Vercel. Patrick is amazed by the recent progress in LLMs that enabled this architecture, and he emphasizes the importance of thorough testing and verification to ensure reliability.",

    "question": "What are ralph loops?",
    "answer": "A ralph loop is an autonomous AI coding pattern where an AI agent like Claude Code runs in a continuous loop, repeatedly working through tasks until a project is complete.\n\nThe key insight is that each iteration gets a fresh context window. The agent picks up where the last left off by reading the filesystem, git history, and progress files rather than carrying over its own conversation context. This helps avoid \"context rot,\" which is the degradation of LLM output quality as conversations grow long. Each iteration performs one task, commits its work, and then the loop restarts with a fresh agent instance.",

    "question": "How has his perspective on AI tools changed?",
    "answer": "Patrick has undergone a dramatic shift in his perspective on AI development tools. Just a few months ago, he had a very different view on how developers should use tools like Claude or Cursor. However, after spending hundreds of hours with the technology, he is now blown away by the pace of development it enables and its ability to build extremely robust, well-tested applications. He is now eager to work in environments where AI-assisted development is encouraged.",
